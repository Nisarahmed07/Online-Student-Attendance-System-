Online Student Attendance System 

🌟 Project Overview
The Online Student Attendance System  is a robust, web-based mini-project designed to digitize and streamline the attendance management process for educational institutions. Developed using the ASP.NET MVC framework, the system replaces manual, error-prone attendance tracking with an efficient, secure, and centralized digital solution.
